# Mad Mix

This is a `python` package that implements Mad Mix,
a flow-based variational methodology to learn discrete distributions.



## Directory roadmap
Each subdirectory contains README files. Generally:
- `src/` contains the source code for MadMix,
including instantiations for discrete-only,
continuous-only (as in Xu et al. (2022)),
and mixed discrete and continuous
- `examples/` has examples where MixFlows are used
to learn different distributions, 
some purely discrete and some including continuous variables as well
- `ipynb/`  contains jupyter notebooks with
 preliminary implementations of the code. (TODO delete.)
