# Discrete Ergodic Flows

This is a `python` package for using MixFlows with discrete variables.


## Directory roadmap
- `discrete_mixflows` contains source code for different
VI methodologies, and specifically contains the source code
for running MixFlows for discrete variables
- `examples/` has examples where MixFlows are used
to learn discrete distributions
- `ipynb/`  contains jupyter notebooks with
 preliminary implementations of the code.
