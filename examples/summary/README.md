# Experiments summary

The `summary.ipynb` Jupyter notebook contains code
to reproduce the summary subfigures in Figure 2 in the paper.

The notebook imports cached results in pickle format from `results/`.
Due to GitHub size constraints,
this directory was compressed first into `results.zip`.
You have to unzip this directory to be able to
run the notebook and generate the figures.
