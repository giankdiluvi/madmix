# Experiments summary

The `summary.ipynb` Jupyter notebook contains code
to reproduce Figure 2 in the paper,
which summarizes the experiments.

The notebook imports cached results in pickle format from `results/`,
but these are not included here due to GitHub size constraint limits.
If you run all the experiments, create the directory first
and it will be populated automatically.
Otherwise, we'd be happy to share the files&mdash;get in touch!
