# Gaussian mixture model

The `Gaussian_mixture_model.ipynb` Jupyter notebook contains code
to reproduce the GMM example.
You should be able to run the whole notebook to get the results,
except those of the Concrete distribution.
Check the examples README to read more about that.



## Directory roadmap
- `Gaussian_mixture_model.ipynb` contains a GMM example
- `fig/` contains figures generated by the notebook
- `sockeye/` contains cached results and output and error messages from running
the Real NVP architecture search on [UBC ARC Sockeye](https://arc.ubc.ca/ubc-arc-sockeye),
UBC's high-performance computing platform
- `sockeye_run/` includes the files necessary to learn the Real NVP Concrete relaxation
- A `madmix_cache/` subdirectory containing
cached pickle files should also be included here
but due to GitHub commit size constraints it cannot be uploaded.
You can still run the Mad Mix code in a reasonable amount of time
by setting `RUN=True` in the appropriate cell.


## Files in `rockeye_run`
- `gmm_run_concrete.py` is the script to reproduce the Concrete relaxation
experiments
- `gmm.pbs` is a file to run the `gmm_run_concrete.py` 144 times
with the architecture settings specificied in `gmm_settings.txt`
- The `*.pkl` files with data to seed the Concrete relaxation,
as well as the results from the flows, losses, and cpu times
would be here but are not included in the repo due to GitHub commit size constraints:
we'd be happy to share the files, though&mdash;get in touch!
