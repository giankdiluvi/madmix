# Ising model

The `Ising_model.ipynb` Jupyter notebook contains code
to reproduce the Ising model example.
You should be able to run the whole notebook to get the results,
except those of dequantization and the Concrete distribution.
Check the `examples/` README to read more about that.



## Directory roadmap
- `Ising_model.ipynb` contains a few Ising model examples
- `fig/` contains figures generated by the notebook
- `sockeye/` contains cached results and output and error messages from running
the Real NVP architecture search on [UBC ARC Sockeye](https://arc.ubc.ca/ubc-arc-sockeye),
UBC's high-performance computing platform
- `sockeye_files/` includes the files necessary to learn the Real NVP Concrete relaxation


For more info on the files in `sockeye` and `sockeye_files`,
check the README of the `examples/` directory.
