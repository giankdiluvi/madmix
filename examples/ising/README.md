# Ising model

The `Ising_model.ipynb` Jupyter notebook contains code
to reproduce the Ising model example.
You should be able to run the whole notebook to get the results,
except those of the Concrete distribution.
Check the examples README to read more about that.



## Directory roadmap
- `Ising_model.ipynb` contains a few Ising model examples
- `fig/` contains figures generated by the notebook
- `sockeye/` contains cached results and output and error messages from running
the Real NVP architecture search on [UBC ARC Sockeye](https://arc.ubc.ca/ubc-arc-sockeye),
UBC's high-performance computing platform
- `sockeye_run/` includes the files necessary to learn the Real NVP Concrete relaxation


## Files in `rockeye_files`
- `ising_run_concrete.py` is the script to reproduce the Concrete relaxation
experiments
- `ising.pbs` is a file to run the `ising_run_concrete.py` 144 times
with the architecture settings specificied in `ising_settings.txt`
- `ising_settings.txt` contains the settings for the Real NVP architecture search
- The `*.pkl` files with data to seed the Concrete relaxation,
as well as the results from the flows, losses, and cpu times
would be here but are not included in the repo due to GitHub commit size constraints:
we'd be happy to share the files, though&mdash;get in touch!
