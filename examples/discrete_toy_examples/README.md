# Discrete toy experiments

The `discrete_examples.ipynb` Jupyter notebook contains code
to reproduce the three discrete toy examples.
You should be able to run the whole notebook to get the results,
except those of Concrete-relaxed flows and dequantization.
Check the examples README to read more about that.



## Directory roadmap
- `fig/` contains figures generated by the notebook
- `onedim/` contains files for the 1D example
- `twodim/` contains files for the 2D example
- `threedim/` contains files for the 3D example
- `mixture/` contains files for the mixture example
- `discrete_examples.ipynb` contains three toy discrete examples:
a univariate discrete distribution,
a bivariate discrete distribution,
and a bivariate mixture
- `toy_run_concrete.py` is the script to reproduce the Concrete relaxation
experiments
- `toy_run_dequant.py` is the script to reproduce the dequantization experiments
