# Discrete toy experiments

The `discrete_examples.ipynb` Jupyter notebook contains code
to reproduce the three discrete toy examples.
You should be able to run the whole notebook to get the results,
except those of the Concrete distribution.
Check the examples README to read more about that.



## Directory roadmap
- `discrete_examples.ipynb` contains three toy discrete examples:
a univariate discrete distribution,
a bivariate discrete distribution,
and a bivariate mixture
- `toy_run_concrete.py` is the script to reproduce the Concrete relaxation
experiments
- `fig/` contains figures generated by the notebook
- `onedim/` contains files for the one-dimensional example
- `twodim/` contains files for the two-dimensional example
- `mixture/` contains files for the mixture example


## Files for each example
Each subdirectory (except `fig/`) has multiple files and subdirectories.
Specifically:
- `*.pbs` is a file to run the `toy_run_concrete.py` 144 times
with the architecture settings specificied in `*_settings.txt`
- `*_settings.txt` contains the settings for the Real NVP architecture search
- `sockeye/` contains cached results and output and error messages from running
the Real NVP architecture search on [UBC ARC Sockeye](https://arc.ubc.ca/ubc-arc-sockeye),
UBC's high-performance computing platform
- The `*.pkl` files with the results from the flows, losses, and cpu times
would be here but are not included in the repo due to GitHub commit size constraints:
we'd be happy to share the files, though&mdash;get in touch!
