# Discrete toy experiments

The `discrete_examples.ipynb` Jupyter notebook contains code
to reproduce the three discrete toy examples.
You should be able to run the whole notebook to get the results,
except those of Concrete-relaxed flows and dequantization.
Check the examples README to read more about that.



## Directory roadmap
- `fig/` contains figures generated by the notebook
- `onedim/` contains files for the 1D example
- `twodim/` contains files for the 2D example
- `threedim/` contains files for the 3D example
- `mixture/` contains files for the mixture example
- `discrete_examples.ipynb` contains three toy discrete examples:
a univariate discrete distribution,
a bivariate discrete distribution,
and a bivariate mixture
- `toy_run_concrete.py` is the script to reproduce the Concrete relaxation
experiments
- `toy_run_dequant.py` is the script to reproduce the dequantization experiments


## Files for each example
Each subdirectory (except `fig/`) has multiple files and subdirectories.
Specifically:
- `*.pbs` is a file to run the `toy_run_concrete.py` 144 times
or `toy_run_dequant.py` 36 times
with the architecture settings specificied in `*_settings.txt`
or `*_settings_dequant.txt` (respectively)
- `*_settings.txt` contains the settings for the Concrete Real NVP architecture search
and `*_settings_dequant.txt` those for the dequantization Real NVP
- `sockeye/` contains cached results and output and error messages from running
the Real NVP architecture search on [UBC ARC Sockeye](https://arc.ubc.ca/ubc-arc-sockeye),
UBC's high-performance computing platform
- The `*.pkl` files with the results from the flows, losses, and cpu times
would be here but are not included in the repo due to GitHub commit size constraints:
we'd be happy to share the files, though&mdash;get in touch!
